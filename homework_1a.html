    <p>Greetings! My name is Aakash Khalasi, 
        I graduated from SFSU in the Fall of 2020 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. 
        In my spare time I enjoy getting exercise, taking my dog for walks, and playing
        electric guitar.

    <p>I am taking this class as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) Programming Certificate 
        and Web Programming Certificate through CSM. I have recently taken HTML5 and CSS during
        Fall of 2023 and I hope that this course helps to solidify some of the skills we practiced
        in that course.

                is an amazing resource for anyone and everyone who wants to learn any programming language.
                I was first introduced to this website when learning Python but I've found it useful for
                practicing and learning other programming languages as well. It provides great examples for
                understanding syntax, as well as access to tutorials and certificates.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn Learning</a> - 
            LinkedIn learning is a great source for lectures on how to use different programming languages and
            technologies. I found it helpful when I was learning how to set up my first Raspberry Pi. It provides
            a lot of practical knowledge on the specific niches of different technologies. It does require a subscription,
            although I was able to access it for free with our SMCCD student email.</li>
