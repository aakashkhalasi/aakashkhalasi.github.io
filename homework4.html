        <h2>Main Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
        <p>
            Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users across multiple platforms and devices.
            They are characterized by several key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive: PWAs adapt and function seamlessly on any device or screen size.</li>
            <li>Connectivity-independent: PWAs can work offline or in low connectivity environments, thanks to service workers that cache essential resources.</li>
            <li>App-like interactions: PWAs offer smooth and immersive user experiences, including push notifications, full-screen mode, and home screen installation.</li>
            <li>Progressive enhancement: PWAs utilize progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality for all users while providing advanced features for modern browsers.</li>
            <li>Secure: PWAs are served over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and user security.</li>
        </ul>
