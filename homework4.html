        <h2>Main Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
        <p>
            Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users across multiple platforms and devices.
            They are characterized by several key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive: PWAs adapt and function seamlessly on any device or screen size.</li>
            <li>Connectivity-independent: PWAs can work offline or in low connectivity environments, thanks to service workers that cache essential resources.</li>
            <li>App-like interactions: PWAs offer smooth and immersive user experiences, including push notifications, full-screen mode, and home screen installation.</li>
            <li>Progressive enhancement: PWAs utilize progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality for all users while providing advanced features for modern browsers.</li>
            <li>Secure: PWAs are served over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and user security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            PWAs offer HTTP Caching, which will cache and reuse previously fetched resources to reduce performance loss and reduce network cost of browser fetching. 
            HTTP caching is implemented through the browser cache, which will store or cache a server response for a specified duration of time before fetching a new server response.
            The HTTP cache will generate a validation token at the time the browser receives a response from the server which is then checked at the end of the duration. The browser will
            first check the local cache, then determine if the resource has changed or not by verifying if a new token was generated by the server. 
        </p>
