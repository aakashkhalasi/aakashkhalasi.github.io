        <h2>Main Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
        <p>
            Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users across multiple platforms and devices.
            They are characterized by several key features:
        </p>
        <p>
            PWAs will use HTTP Caching, which will cache and reuse previously fetched resources to reduce performance loss and reduce network cost of browser fetching. 
            HTTP caching is implemented through the browser cache, which will store or cache a server response for a specified duration of time before fetching a new server response.
            The HTTP cache will generate a validation token at the time the browser receives a response from the server which is then checked at the end of the duration. The browser will
            first check the local cache, then determine if the resource has changed or not by verifying if a new token was generated by the server. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Web push notifications are also used by PWAs by implementing a push service. The push service will receive the "Time to Live" and the "Urgency of the Message" from the browser
            and then route the push messages to the user. A service worker is used to monitor these messages from the push service, and will send the notifications to the user accordingly.
            These push settings are also stored in subscription tokens, similar to validation tokens used in HTTP caching.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web App Manifest is a JSON file that gives the developer the ability to control how the user will see the application. The manifest will also define the appearance
            of the application when it is launched. The manifest is usually stored at the root of the application and is absolutely required for PWAs. The manifest will define and store
            a list of properties specifed by the developer to set icons, display properties, etc. The manifest can also be used to include a splash screen which will load while the rest of
            the page or application resources are being loaded.
